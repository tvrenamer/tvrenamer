    /**
     * Try to figure out the state of the world after a call to Files.move
     * did not succeed, nor did it completely fail.
     *
     * <p>Note, java.nio.file.Files.move() is defined to return the destination.
     * Is it possible that the file could be moved, but to a different
     * destination than was requested?  Nothing in the Javadoc suggests that it
     * could.
     *
     * <p>As far as I can tell, the best reason for Files.move to return a Path,
     * rather than a boolean "success" value, is to simplify the user's code
     * when the destination is passed in as an expression, so that instead of:
     * <pre>
     * <code>
     *    Path destFile = destDir.resolve(basename + suffix)
     *    boolean success = Files.move(src, destFile);
     *    if (success) {
     *      // do something with destFile
     * </code>
     * </pre>
     * ... you can do:
     * <pre>
     * <code>
     *    Path destFile = Files.move(src, destDir.resolve(basename + suffix));
     *    if (destFile != null) {
     *      // do something with destFile
     * </code>
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p>Nevertheless, I don't know that for 100% certain.  The specification
     * implies a hypothetical possibility that the file might be moved, but to a
     * location different from target.  Particularly since the whole point of
     * this program is to move files, I want to try to be as careful as we can
     * possibly be to not lose (track of) any files.
