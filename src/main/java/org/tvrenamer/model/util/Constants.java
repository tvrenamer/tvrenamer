/**
 * Constants.java -- the most important reason for this class to exist is for pieces of
 *    information that are shared throughout the program, so that if they should ever
 *    have to change, they can be changed in one place.
 *
 * Even for values that are used only once, though, it can be advantageous to give them
 * symbolic names rather than inlining the values directly into the code.  And it can
 * be nicer to consolidate all such values in one place, rather than cluttering up the
 * top of every file with its own values.
 *
 * Putting them in one place also allows us to see all the values "at once."  If this were
 * an application being developed for a private company, we might have some non-developer
 * reviewing all the words we present to the user (as well as all the files we might read
 * or create, etc.)  With an open-source project... well, we can still review them,
 * ourselves.  :-)
 *
 * But there's another reason for moving stuff here, and that's as a midway point to some
 * non-code solution.  Particularly if we ever want to localize the application, having
 * strings hard-coded into methods makes it pretty much impossible.  We'd want to get the
 * strings from resource files.
 *
 * It is not, of course, necessary to have this intermediate step; we could go straight from
 * inlined strings to resource files.  This just makes it easier to do it incrementally.
