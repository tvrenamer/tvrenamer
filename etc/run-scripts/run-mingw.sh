# run-mingw.sh -- quick and dirty (albeit heavily-commented) script to run
#  the TVRenamer app without "launch4j" or any similar functionality.

# This will optionally run "ant compile", which builds a bunch of class
# files in the "out" directory.  (If you don't enable that option, we
# assume it's because you've already run ant.)

# I wrote this to be run from "git bash" for Windows, which is mingw32.
# It has specific functionality to use Windows paths, and to choose the
# right SWT jarfile.  To run on a different platform, the script would
# need to be edited slightly.  To try to make sure you do that, it actually
# doesn't run on any other platforms.  But again, trivial to change that.

# This script automatically redirects stdout into a hard-coded location.
# It would be very easy to edit the script if you don't like that.

# If anyone wants to run anywhere else, make it work
